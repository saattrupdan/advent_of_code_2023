# Advent of Code 2023

These are my Rust solutions for the 2023 edition of [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

To run them firstly ensure that [Rust is
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), after which you can run the
command

```
cargo run --bin dayX-Y
```

Here `X` is the day of the month and `Y` is the task number, which can be 1 or 2. For
instance, `cargo run --bin day1-1` runs the first task of December 1.
